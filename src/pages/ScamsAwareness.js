        Overview:
        </h1>
        <p>
        Phishing attacks remain one of the most common cyber threats, and they’re becoming more sophisticated. 
        Cybercriminals send deceptive emails, SMS text messages, or social media posts that appear to be from trusted sources like banks, schools,
        or even family members, aiming to steal sensitive information. 
        In addition to Phishing and Smishing attacks be aware of QR code phishing attacks as well.
        </p>
        <h4>How It Works:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>A family member receives a seemingly legitimate message asking them to click on a link or provide personal details.</li>
          <li>The link leads to a fake website that looks real, tricking them into entering sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.</li>
          <li>Once the information is provided, cybercriminals can access your accounts or use your details for identity theft.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Protection Tips:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Educate your family about the dangers of phishing and how to spot suspicious messages.</li>
          <li>Encourage everyone to verify the authenticity of any unexpected emails or texts by contacting the sender directly.</li>
          <li>Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all important accounts to add an extra layer of security.</li>
          <li>Never scan a QR code without being sure it is legitimate.  When in doubt DO NOT scan.</li>

        Overview:
        </h1>
          <p>
            Ransomware is a form of malware that can lock your family out of their own devices, demanding a ransom to regain access. This type of attack can be devastating, leading to the loss of precious family photos, important documents, or financial records.
          </p>
          <h4>How It Works:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Ransomware often spreads through malicious email attachments, infected websites, or compromised software downloads.</li>
            <li>Once it infects a device, it encrypts files and displays a ransom note demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key.</li>
            <li>Paying the ransom doesn’t guarantee the recovery of your files, and it may make your family a target for future attacks.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Protection Tips:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Regularly back up important family files to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service.</li>
            <li>Ensure all devices in your home have up-to-date antivirus software and avoid downloading files from untrusted sources.</li>
            <li>Educate your family about safe online practices, including avoiding suspicious email attachments or links.</li>

        <div className="impersonation-text">
          <h4>Overview:</h4>
          <p>
            Impersonation scams involve cybercriminals pretending to be someone you trust, such as a family member, friend, or even a government official. These scams can come through phone calls, emails, or social media, and often involve urgent requests for money or personal information.
          </p>
          <h4>How It Works:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>You or a family member receives a message from someone claiming to be in trouble or needing immediate assistance.</li>
            <li>The scammer might pose as a grandchild in distress, a family friend needing financial help, or a government official requesting personal details.</li>
            <li>The urgency and emotional appeal of the message can make it difficult to think clearly, leading victims to comply without verifying.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Protection Tips:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Establish a family code word to verify the identity of someone asking for help in an emergency. A unique family question with answers that don’t match the question can also help authenticate the person.</li>
            <li>Encourage your family to always double-check the situation by contacting the person directly through a known phone number or other trusted means.</li>
            <li>Be cautious about sharing personal information online and limit what you post on social media to avoid giving scammers material they can use.</li>

          <h4>Overview:</h4>
          <p>
            Tech support scams prey on families by convincing them that their computers or devices are infected with viruses. Cybercriminals pose as representatives from well-known companies like Microsoft or Apple, offering to fix non-existent problems for a fee.
          </p>
          <h4>How It Works:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A family member may receive a pop-up message, phone call, or email claiming their device is infected and urging them to contact "tech support."</li>
            <li>The scammer then asks for remote access to the device, pretending to fix the problem while installing malware or stealing personal information.</li>
            <li>They may also charge a fee for the "service," adding financial loss to the risk of compromised security.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Protection Tips:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Remind your family that legitimate tech companies will never contact you unsolicited about a virus or security issue.</li>
            <li>Never allow remote access to your devices from unknown callers or pop-up messages.</li>
            <li>Keep your devices protected with reliable antivirus software and educate your family on how to respond to tech support scams.</li>

          <h4>Overview:</h4>
          <p>
            As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, scammers are finding new ways to exploit people’s interest in digital currencies. They may offer fake investment opportunities, fraudulent exchanges, or "get rich quick" schemes that target those less familiar with how cryptocurrencies work.
          </p>
          <h4>How It Works:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Scammers set up fake websites or social media posts that promise high returns on cryptocurrency investments or offer exclusive mining opportunities.</li>
            <li>They convince victims to invest money or provide personal information, only for the investment to turn out to be fake or the details to be used for identity theft.</li>
            <li>The anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions can make it difficult to trace or recover lost funds.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Protection Tips:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Have open discussions with your family, especially teens and young adults, about the risks and rewards of cryptocurrency investments.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly research any investment opportunities and only use reputable exchanges and wallets for transactions.</li>
            <li>Be skeptical of any offers that guarantee high returns with little risk, as these are often scams.</li>
